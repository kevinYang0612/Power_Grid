# Power_Grid

●	Developed a power grid construction solution for a real-world scenario by utilizing a text file 
  containing a list of locations and associated costs between them.
●	Implemented Kruskal's algorithm using a graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) in Java, incorporating efficient data structures 
  such as Union-Find, Min-Heap, and uptree.
●	Successfully determined the minimum spanning tree, enabling rapid identification of the most cost-effective approach for 
  constructing a power grid in a given area.
